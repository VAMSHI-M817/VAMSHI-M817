# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Vamshi!

Welcome to my coding universe! ðŸš€ As a fullstack web developer, I'm constantly exploring the realms of code, pushing boundaries, and crafting digital experiences that leave a mark.

## ðŸ’» Tech Wizardry

I wield an arsenal of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. From the front-end magic to the back-end sorcery, I thrive on turning ideas into interactive realities. Here are just a few of my favorite tools:

```javascript
const vamshi = {
  code: ["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"],
  technologies: {
    frontEnd: {
      js: ["React", "Angular"],
      css: ["Bootstrap", "Tailwind CSS", "SASS"]
    },
    backEnd: {
      js: ["Node.js", "Express"],
    },
    databases: ["MongoDB", "MySQL", "PostgreSQL", "SQLite"],
    devOps: ["Docker", "Git", "GitHub Actions"],
    misc: ["Firebase", "GraphQL", "RESTful APIs"]
  },
  tools: ["Visual Studio Code", "Git", "Postman", "Figma"]
};
